### Portray Learning: A Novel Learning Paradigm for Streaming Emerging Class Detection

![avatar](./overview/frame.png)

## Introduction

Portray Learning is a novel learning paradigm to tackle the problem of streaming emerging class detection. It contains a series of portrayers that correspond one-to-one with data classes. Then realize known class classification and unknown class detection through multiple independent outlier identification tasks. Meanwhile, the Extreme Value Theory (EVT) is used to automatically determine the outlier threshold. 

## Requirements

```bash
pip install scipy
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install tqdm
pip install matplotlib
pip install sklearn
pip install torch
```

## Model Architecture

The model architecture is stored in ./code/portrayer.py. 
```bash
portrayer.py
```

## Outlier Detection

The Extreme Value Theory (EVT) calculations is stored in ./code/evt.py. 
```bash
evt.py
```

## Simulated Stream

A demo of the simulated data stream based on KDDCup 99 is stored in ./code/data_loader.py. 
```bash
data_loader.py
```

|Dataset | #classes | #attributes|
|:--------|:---------:|--------:|
|KDDCup 99 | 4 | 41|
|Forest Cover | 7 | 10|
|HAR | 6 | 561|
|Satimage | 6 | 32|
|USPS | 10 | 256|
|Pendigits | 10 | 16|

## Running

To perform this test code, enter the ./code/ folder, run with
```bash
python main_process.py
```

## Real-World Stream

A real-world stream from New York Times API is used that includes 10k new items involving 8 classes, i.e. "Arts", "Business Day", "Fashion & Style", "N.Y./Region", "Sports", "Technology", "U.S.", "World". The ./code/real/real_stream.json stores the real-world data stream distribution.
